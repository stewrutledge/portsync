portsync is a utility for performing incremental backups without the need of a full backup to diff from.

When a full backup is taken (or the argument -t gen-hash is passed) a master list is created with the ctime of all items in the source folder. When portsync is ran with -t portable, a new list of ctimes is created, which is then diffed against the previous list a file is created and passed to rsync, backing up only files that have changed since the last master list generation, without a backup on the other end to diff from.

Usage: portsync -t [type] -s [source] -d [destination]
or
Usage: portsync -t [type] -c [configfile]

Valid types: 

normal: Performs a normal rysnc and builds master_hash after complete

portable: Performas an incremental backup of changes, without the need of a full backup on the destination end 

gen-hash: Rebuilds hash without a sync. Only -s (source) or -c (config file) should be specified.

portsync.linux uses the stat formatting for normal linux based OSes, while portsync.bsd uses the bsd formatting (as well as OSX).

portsync.cfg.example is a commented example of how to create a config file to be used.
